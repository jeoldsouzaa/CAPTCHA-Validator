Captcha Validator

This project provides a robust solution for validating CAPTCHA images. It leverages advanced image processing techniques and machine learning models to accurately identify and verify CAPTCHAs.

Features:

Image Preprocessing:
Noise reduction
Image segmentation
Character isolation
Character Recognition:
Utilizes state-of-the-art OCR models (e.g., Tesseract OCR, OpenCV)
Handles various CAPTCHA types (text-based, image-based)
Machine Learning Integration:
Trains custom models on specific CAPTCHA datasets
Improves accuracy and adaptability to different CAPTCHA formats
API Integration:
Provides a RESTful API for easy integration into web applications
Accepts CAPTCHA images as input and returns validation results
How to Use:

Installation:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/jeoldsouzaa/captcha-validator.git
cd captcha-validator
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

API Usage:
Python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/validate"
files = {'captcha_image': open('captcha.png', 'rb')}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print("Validation failed")
Use code with caution.
